# Create a Calculator with JavaScript
#### Grades: 6-8th
#### Time for Prep:   20 mins
#### Time for Set-up: 5 mins
#### Time for Lesson: 2 hour
#### Learning Objectives: 
  * The students will understand variables and if statements in JavaScript. 
  * The students will understand how to create a basic design when given a problem to be solved by computation. 
#### Learning Outcomes: 
  * The students will use variable(s) in their calculator program.
  * The students will use an if statement in their calculator program.
  * The students will create a design for their calculator program.
#### Material Needed:
  * Laptops or Desktop computers with internet access
  * Handouts for the calculator problem. See file -> [Lesson Handout](handouts/calulator_with_JavaScript.pdf)
  * A sheet of paper that will allow them to write down their design
  * Pencils
  * Paper
  * White board pens (if white board available)
#### Prep:
  * Print handouts
  * Optional: Create signs for the corners to play in the If Game
#### Set-Up:
  * Set up computers with a browser screen open
#### Lesson Plan:
###### Opener: The If Game (whole group)
  * Similar to the game Four Corners.
  * This game is designed to teach students the basics of if statements and familiarize them with the language used when talking about if statements. 
  * Game play:
    * Students and parents all start in one corner. 
    * They are asked a question (questions should be easy, fun, and engaging).
    * If the answer (the if) is not true for them, they move to the next corner. 
    * If the second answer (the else if)  does not apply to them, they move to the last corner. 
    * Students stay in the last corner (the else). 
    * Repeat for a couple of rounds. 
###### Main Activities:
  1. Explain Variables (whole group)
     * Use a visual method (such as the bucket metaphor) to go over what a variable is and what they are used for.
     * Different data types will also be discussed, so students understand that a variable can hold a number, string, etc.
  2. If statement and variable demonstration in Javascript (whole group)
     * Will allow students and parents to see how to create and use variables in Javascript. 
     * Will allow students and parents to see how if statements are structured and used in Javascript.
     * Will allow students and parents to understand how to take in input and print to the console. 
  3. Design the calculator (whole group)
     * Walk the students through designing a problem that can be solved computationally. 
     * Go through understanding the problem to make sure all students understand what the problem is asking before they try to solve the problem.
     * The flowchart method can be used.
     * Help students think about how the tools they learned (variables and if statements) can be used to help them create a calculator.
  4. Create the Calculator (individual parent-student activity)
     * Use Repl.it to create the calculator in Javascript.
     * The students and parents will implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
     * For extended learning, students can implement different equations.
     * For further learning, students can implement a ui for their calculator.
     * Sample full calculator (no ui): https://repl.it/@KaitlinDeeDee/JavaScript-Calculator  
     * Sample calculator with ui: https://repl.it/@Aidenjn/calculator-UI

###### Closer: Reflection
  * Give parents and students a few questions to talk about together.
  * Open up the conversation to the whole group and allow anyone to answer. 
  * Have a few volunteers share their flowchart. Have them share how/why they approached the problem the way that they did.
  * Questions:
    * What was the easiest part of making the calculator? 
    * What was the most difficult part of creating the calculator?
    * What was something that happened that you didnâ€™t expect?
    * Do you think you would use this in real life? Why or why not?
    * What else do you think you can do with the skills you learned today?
    * Someone give me an example of something else that is programmable. [Discuss how everything is a program]
    * Do you think you could/would want to do this again on your own?
    * Did you understand all of the steps that we performed? Were there any steps that were harder/easier than others?
    * How does this change your perspective about the calculator you use in class or on your phone/computer?
    * Would you want to continue this project, or work on something new?


#### Possible Issues
  * A student/parent does not bring a laptop or their laptop dies.
    * The school has chromebooks the students can borrow.
    * We bring extension cords in case there is not a near-by outlet.
  * A student comes but their guardians are not there.
    * If there are two students, we could make them buddies.
    * We check in on that student more often to make sure they are doing well.
  * Tantrum
    * Ask to take a break or a walk with them or just watch
    * The students are mostly too young for the lesson
    * Scale back our lesson to do less. 
    * Take 5 minute breaks
