### Learning Objectives:
This is what you want students to learn during the lesson. This should be the big idea. There should be no explanation yet of how 
you will go about doing this.  

The learning objectives should be shared with the students. It is just as important for students to know what they are supposed to 
be learning as it is important for students to complete the provided activities. 

It’s important to start with learning objectives because you need to first identify what the students need to learn before you can 
help them get to that point.  

### Assessment of Objectives:
You need to measure student understanding during every lesson. Some informal assessments should happen during the lesson. A few 
examples of assessments are answering questions on a whiteboard, having multiple hand signals for a question, and exit tickets. 

Students should also receive feedback on their learning. Any feedback is going to help a student think deeper about what they are 
learning and strengthen their understanding. 

### Language Support:
Every classroom will have a diverse population of students. Students will have a ranging comprehension of language skills and 
abilities. Added to this, Computer Science often brings its own complicated vocabulary. The lesson needs to support the language 
needs of students. Some examples are defining vocabulary for students or having pictures students can refer to. 

### Lesson Plan:
All lessons need to have some lecture and activities to help students learn and understand the material. Students will finish at a 
variety of times and lessons should account for this. It is important to have extra or challenge activities for early finishers.  
Lessons should also take into account that a student may not finish every activity. Order the activities in such a way that 
students will still learn the desired objective, without finishing every activity. 

When creating activities, for early finishers, it is good to have some challenging options. These activities should be more open 
ended and creative. They should be less guided. Think of it more like, use this tool to do an activity of the student’s choosing.

Lessons should have an opener. The opener is a great place to engage students’ prior knowledge about lesson. Openers can be a 
thought-provoking question, video, reading a passage, a simulation, along with many other things.

Lessons should also include a closing activity. This is often tied to assessment. Closure is a way to have students synthesize 
whatthey have learned. It should always tie back to the objectives. Examples are turning to a neighbor and answering some questions 
or exit tickets.

Each part of the lesson should include support for students. Each classroom is going to be diverse and how students are going to 
supported needs to be thought about as each activity is being created.

### Potential Issues:
Issues should be avoided, but sometimes that isn’t possible. You should list out potential issues and solutions. After the first 
draft of the lesson plan is written, all potential issues should be written down, then go back through the lesson and see if any of 
them can be handled. If there are some that can’t be prevented, keep them and write down some solutions. An example of an 
unavoidable problem is having technical trouble with a computer for a lesson. Some solutions should also be listed out like getting 
a new laptop, restarting the device, etc.

### Things to keep in mind when designing a lesson plan:
* Start with the end in mind
  * Think about what you want students to learn
  * Create a lesson that will get students to that point 
* Keep it simple 
  * More complicated doesn’t mean you created a better lesson
  * Use concise and clear language to promote student understanding 
  * It is more beneficial for students to master the basics than be confused by the complicated 
  * Limit multi-tasking, focus on one goal at a time
* Relate the lesson to something students already understand 
  * Anchor thinking in what students already know 
  * Students will make connections faster if they are able to go back to previous knowledge 
* Anticipate the Unexpected 
  * Look for areas where students may struggle 
  * Be sensitive to those areas and address them when necessary 
* Collaborate with team members 
  * Rely on your team members for feedback and ideas 
* Learn from past mistakes 
  * If something in a lesson doesn’t work out, that’s okay 
  * Learn from that and make the lesson better in the future
