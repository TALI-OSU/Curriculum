# Process to Create Curriculum
### In our group, follow this process to get the curriculum created and ready for use
* Go to the google drive
* Go to the curriculum folder
* Create a folder with the date of the outreach event
* Copy over the curriculum template in the the newly created folder. The template should be renamed with the lesson title
* Fill out the curriculum template and prepare any other documents needed for the outreach. All of these forms should go in the folder that was just created
* Contact the curriculum coordinator for review. This should be done at least 4 days before the outreach event
* Make any changes both you and the curriculum coordinator decide upon
* Contact the material manager, so they can get all materials ready. This should be done at least 24 hours before the outreach event
